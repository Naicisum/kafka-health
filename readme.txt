Kafka Health

The intent of this is to produce one or more scripts that will interrogate kafka
using the scripts from the $KAFKA_ROOT/bin folder. The output from these scripts
will be re-parsed into a more manageable format and hopefully provide meaningful
output for troubleshooting potential issues with applications using kafka as
well as issues within kafka itself.
